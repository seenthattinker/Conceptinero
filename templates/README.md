SR&ED Preparation Templates
===================================


The Conceptinero Template is a suite of simple,
self-documented modules that build the SR&ED application by focusing on every stage,
and every definition related to a SR&ED application.
The templates were designed to be like a personal assistant that is with you throughout the first draft,
guiding you and answering your questions at every step of the SR&ED process.
The whole GitHub site works as stage one of the SR&ED process.

The Wiki provides an excellent overview of the SR&ED process from first steps to preparing for an audit.
In the end,
you will understand that SR&ED is a state of mind that must be sustained throughout the fiscal year.
It's about building things,
both tangible technology and knowledge advancement in science or technology.

The real key to the whole process is slowly walking through it,
concentrating on one definition at a time,
then concatenating them into a well edited and succinct application.

The template is broken into separate files which allow you to focus on precisely what you need to focus on.
