A continuation of the Sails and Anchors gamification tool developed in 2019,
this body of work focused on abstracting the backdrop canvas (treasure map) and plotting tools (sails and anchors) for any type of plotting/mapping activity.
This required building a custom admin form for the tool that allowed for complete customization of the canvas backdrop,
mapping icons,
label text/descriptors,
and the like.
No other library or module existed,
Impetus needed to custom develop this functionality.

how would backdrop canvas and plotting tools normally be used,
and why were they limited in this case? We can build an arguement around these points as the uncertainties.

I can't seem to find any comparable tools.
You could say that this tool was built on the jQuery Draggable and Droppable libraries.
The ability to drag and drop items is a key part of this feature.
