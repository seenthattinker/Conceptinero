Impetus
==================




Improved Reporting Automation 

There are no Drupal modules that can extract webform information and

display it according to our standards and requirements. We were uncertain how to scale development upon the Drupal Webform and Highcharts libraries, and at the same time achieve integration with Impetus Digital's own custom content creation and activity tracking components without negatively impacting performance or architecture.

 

Digital "Sails and Anchors" Gamification Tool

The Sails & Anchors concept is something that is unique to Impetus. It was uncertain how to integrate a gamification concept, and implement the touch gesture capabilities, on a mobile device, to yield better engagement and  cognition as participants are able to easily document their thoughts and compare/contrast with others’ thoughts using a touch gesture on a mobile device. 

 

Speech-to-text for Drupal Comment Threads

There are no tools currently available (like Dragon Medical, or nVoq), that would allow us to directly integrate Google Speech to Text in our discussion forums. We found these solutions did not work on all of our supported browsers. Especially did not support safari, and layer-over webpages, and we could not control interface. 

 

Buying Path Custom Webform Implementation

We needed to be able to make sure that the values in multiple webform fields add up to values entered in other fields within the same form. There are no Drupal modules that are able to do this. The webform validation module is the most advanced module including documentation to show how to validate a webform to date, but it was inadequate for our needs.
