PORTAL BUILDER AUTOMATION

we wanted asynchronous task tracking by percentage completed for our automatic portal builder.
There was no out-of-the-box add-on available.
we needed an integrated data collection and workflow solution to collect structured data from the initial sales process through to the delivery and closure of client projects.




SAILS AND ANCHOR TOOL

We needed to abstract our backdrop canvas,
treasure map,
and plotting tools,
sails and anchors,
for any type of plotting/mapping activity.
We needed to extend our drag and drop functionality.

PRIOR AND POST SESSION EVENT ACTIVITIES


We programmed events prior to,
in session,
and post session,
to provide a schedule to a virtual gathering.


PORTAL BUILDER AUTOMATION

Two major features were added this year.
Automatic progress tracking for all types of asynchronous activities within the portal,
and the corollary UX front end design so advisers know where they are within a checkpoint.
This can be auto-deployed with the portal builder automation.
Previously,
we only had progress tracking on the client reporting side,
but not for the end user themselves.
There were no existing options in the Drupal open source community that met all of our needs.
We had to build our own around touchpoints.
We built the automation of form creation at the administrator level
&mdash;
the InSite Surveyor
&mdash;
so the virtual collaboration can take registered input.
We built upon the Drupal form module,
but the auto-creation was built interdependently atop that.

SAILS AND ANCHOR TOOL

This is a gamified canvas that allows users to drag and drop icons to populate scenarios.
We extended our custom Drupal module to allow for the upload of custom icons and graphics.


### What scientific or technological advancements did you achieve or attempt to achieve as a result of the work described in line 244? (Maximum 350 words)

We pushed the capabilities of Drupal as a CMS to become the foundation of a synchronous event management platform.
We accomplished this by substantially adding to the Drupal modules library.
We advanced automated portal creation to further customize the online collaboration platform we have created,
maintain,
and expand.
We extended Drupal significantly by allowing it to operate with Zoom through a bridged API that permits the site authentication and role allotment
&mdash;
manager,
organizer,
administrator,
and participant,
among others
&mdash;
by our system as opposed to the login system associated with Zoom.

In many ways,
we fabricated an ERP atop the Drupal CMS,
incorporating Google Workspace.
