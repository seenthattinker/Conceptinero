CYSSC Platform Modernization T661    
====================================


We created a detailed process to move three layer systems from a legacy infrastructure to the cloud.
We thoroughly documented the stages from UNIX/IBM/AIX to RHEL and then to GoCloud for cloud deployment and maintenance.

We wrote our reusable business plan in strict conformity with *GO-ITS 25.21 Cloud First Principles and Security Requirements*,
The Ontario Public Service (OPS) security and compliance standard.

We proved that RHEL is the best Linux platform for the level of support the Ministry requires and ease of use,
making it our go-to solution for cloud migrations from UNIX variants.

The plan we created includes new ITS GoCloud infrastructure,
decommissioning existing Common Cluster Platform (CCP),
adopting Cloud technology,
performance tuning,
and setting up a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) inclusive of infrastructure.
We wrote and planned the DRP,
in terms of infrastructure and responsiveness,
in line with a mission critical application in the financial sector.
We sequentially migrated
applications,
data,
conceptually ported to the cloud,
developed sprints to migrate with no application interruption between legacy and cloud.  
We automated delivery team automation.

In short,
we developed a methodology so extensive it constitutes a best-in-class migration from UNIX to the cloud with Linux as the connector.
The plans and steps to realize this now constitute a competitive advantage for us in a marketplace rich with legacy UNIX applications,
specifically on IBM,
looking to migrate to the cloud.

We provided invaluable knowledge and experience to the Ministry,
which they can now share with the Ontario Public Sector for more defined Requests for Proposals (RFPs) from vendors.
We have also given ourselves a marked advantage in this marketplace because we can respond to RFPs with more precision and acumen than any vendor who has not realized a UNIX to cloud legacy migration.
