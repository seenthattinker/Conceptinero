XpertVR &reg; exists in the virtual reality (VR) market space.
They produce simulations for training purposes and tools for market research.

### New email distribution for networked VR

Their main client for 2020 was Conestoga College,
which has a Police Foundations diploma program.
XpertVR produces VR simulations for the college program.
Prior to Covid 19 the simulations were real.
Actors would go to the college and play roles in designed crimes scenes
&mdash;
a dead body,
a witness,
and various critical elements to an investigation.
The college decided that VR simulations would supplement the foregone in-class study due to the stay at home orders in Ontario and elsewhere.

XpertVR designed seven crime scenes to be experienced with VR.
They are accessed online with a headset at home.
When they step into the crime scene they are given the details on how to navigate around,
interact with it,
and the basic case file as understood is imparted to the student.
They are then free to do their classwork in the 3D VR crime scene.

Each crime scene required a data collection and dispersal for the student and the professor overseeing the class/student.
The data collection was different for both parties.
Each of the seven crime scenes had multiple sub-scenarios for experience and random user experience,
so each student would have a different and random experience with the VR.
Each student has their VR experience assembled as a file which is sent to them,
as well as a separate file sent to the professor.
The file represents their decisions in the VR,
and from that the student writes the final report,
on which they are graded.

The unique aspect of this was the email component,
specifically the separate reports for the two grades of participants,
the student and the professor.
There were no existing libraries for this kind of development.
We diligently investigated and found nothing that suited our purpose.
We tried several third party solutions,
but they did not meet our needs.
We had to build this from scratch.
It represents a new email interface for networked VR applications.
It is absolutely reusable and it absolutely gives us a market advantage.

### Market research Brock University

The business faculty is using XpertVR templates to conduct market research studies.
One example is testing impulse buying.
Placing products at the front of the store which people might only buy upon seeing.
The research was designed to determine what forms buying patterns outside of what a user might need.
As this is being built out data collection tools are being created.
These data collection models will make us faster and better for other clients and are completely reusable.

We built an eye-mapping tool,
so as a VR user is going through a scenario a heat map is drawn when they stare at products.
This is not new to the VR creation space,
but ours works in tandem with a survey tool,
the other most important thing for the professors,
making our product one-stop shopping for market research in the academic and private sectors.
