Validation Capital exists in the blockchain market,
specifically in secure node infrastructure.
Blockchain stores information,
executes transactions,
performs functions,
and needs trust in an open environment predicated on privacy.
Our technical uncertainty is the configuration of infrastructure with secure nodes in a marketplace
&mdash;
blockchain
&mdash;
that is in a perpetual state of rapid evolution.

We are tasked with ground-level architecture consultancy in blockchain projects.
We are given a set of criteria,

In many ways it has come to redefine what open source means,
taking away from Linux as the new,

An entire digital marketplace is being set up on the blockchain.
Blockchain may be seen the same as continuous development,
continuous integration (CD/CI),
or as a process that is the product,
as opposed to a process that produces something.
